## Reason to create
I shop every week, but I forget to get things from the store. Also, if I want to make a dish or a recipe, it is hard to know the things that I actually have. This will create a database that will allow me to know what food I have, and allow me to automatically update the database by scanning a reciept.

## What it does

Swedish Chef will have many components. The first being a receipt scanner for walmart. It will extract line by line the things purchased on a certain date. It will also collect the data for the store that things were purchased at. This is to create a database of store information, as well as just a reference for when and where things were purchased
